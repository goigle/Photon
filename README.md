Schmal appears to have gone AWOL, and Photon features are slowly breaking. This repository aims to fix any broken features and add new content when possible.
We have a fix for liveries in this repository, however it is not a full fix as the number generator on Schmal's site is not functioning.

Pull requests are welcome, but code may be adjusted before publish. Anyone who contributes will not be appropriately credited on the official addon page because this isn't the official addon.
